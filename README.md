### Hi there, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I am an experienced full stack developer with a penchant for server-side programming and an affinity for of Ruby and Ruby on Rails (and React, too!). I am most at home working on the backend, love API architcture, and think Postman is one the greatest tools at my disposal. I have experience with ORM tools (ActiveRecord), PostgreSQL, and [deploying full stack applicatons on Render](https://burgerbuddy.onrender.com/). 

My background is in investment real estate, banking, and entrepreneurship. I am client-focused with a provable track record of business strategy, client acquisition and retention, market research, employee/vendor management and relations, crisis management, legal and regulatory compliance, and financial management. I am excited to leverage these skills, among others, in a software development environment.

When not at my desk, you can catch me pedaling two wheels on the [Katy Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Trail_State_Park), camping in the Ozarks with my wife and two daughters, or lost in the woods somewhere between Asheville and Moab (or daydreaming about the P2P/STR architecture-focused app I'm slowly building!). If it's after midnight and my wife and daughters are soundly asleep, you can find me slowly but surely teaching myself Solidity, reading everything I can about the [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) and smart contracts (with a particular interest in oracles), or studying for my AWS Developer Certificate.  

Check out some links and projects below and feel free to get in touch!

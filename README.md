### Hi there, I'm Ryan 👋

I am an experienced full stack developer with a penchant for server-side programming and a lover of Ruby and Ruby On Rails (and React, too!). My background is in investment real estate, banking, and entrepreneurship. I am client-focused with a provable track record of business strategy, client acquisition and retention, market research, employee/vendor management and relations, legal and regulatory compliance, and financial management. I have a strong desire to utilize the culmination of my previous experience and knowledge in creative ways to develop elegant and efficient software solutions. 

When not at my desk, you can catch me pedaling two wheels on the Katy Trail, camping in the Ozarks with my wife and two daughters, or lost in the woods somewhere between Asheville and Moab (or daydreaming about the P2P/STR architecture app I hope to shop around soon!). 

Please check out some of my projects below and feel free to contact me! 👇
